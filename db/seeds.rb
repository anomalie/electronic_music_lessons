The deep sound of bass or the high pitch of a sirens wail, all differentiated in our brains as variating frequencies.  Sound is essentially energy as an audiible waveform, with frequency being defined as the speed of that sound per cycle measured in Hertz  Humans have a hearing range of 20hz-20khz.", picture: "EQ.png", tutorial_id: 1},

  {name: "Section Two", category: "content", body: "Synthesizer envelopes consists of four parameters: Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release. Attack indicates the volume of the initial note attack.  Decay is the amount of volume that decreases.
   Sustain controls the volume at which the sound will loop until the key is release. Which brings use to the release parameter, which is how fast the volume fades after that key release. Check out the video tutorial below.",

  {name: "Section One", category: "content", body: "A lead synth sound needs to “cut through” the sonic space in which it’s set. Keep in mind how focused the bandwidth of a lead guitar is. You don’t want a frequency-bloated sound that masks everything, or worse, gets masked by everything else. It needs to play nicely with others. That said, there’s room for a lot of diversity here. 
    A smooth lead sound perfect for instrumental jazz is not going to work for hard progressive rock, for example.",

  {name: "Section Two", category: "content", body: "Related to the attack, legato/solo mode is typically desirable for leads. This gives the player more articulation options by letting intuitive legato playing technique determine envelope re-triggering. ",

  {name: "Section Three", category:"content", body: "Harmonic activity is important for sustain—this is where the emotion is. This sonic movement, even if it’s subtle, enhances held notes, allowing them to “sing” for quite some time. Synth soloing is similar to singing from a phrasing point of view, so you should dial in slow but steady modulation of harmonics to create the same effect a good singer naturally employs, subtly varying the sustained tone.",

  {name: "Section Four", category: "content", body: "If available on your controller keyboard, try using release velocity to modulate envelope release time so that a fast key-up causes a fast release time; and a slow key up causes a slow one. Details like this increase playability.",
